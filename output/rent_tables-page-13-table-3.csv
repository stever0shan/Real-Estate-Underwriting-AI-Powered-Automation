"","One Chicago Square
Expected to cost more than $700 million, the two-tower project would 
occupy the block just west of Holy Name, at State and Superior streets, 
and include 900 apartments and condominiums, a health club and spa, 
and a grocery store. It would be one of the biggest housing projects 
ever built in downtown Chicago, with one tower rising 76 stories and 
the other rising 45.
A  developer  took  the  wraps  of  its  ambitious  plan  to  turn  the  large 
parking lot across from Chicago’s Holy Name Cathedral in River North 
into a $740 million mixed-use complex anchored by two very tall and 
thin skyscrapers. Rising to a height of up to 1,011 feet, the taller of the 
pair would become the Windy City’s sixth tallest building if approved 
and constructed as proposed.
